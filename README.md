# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Java. 
It serves as a personal learning resource and a repository for solving Advent of Code (AoC) and LeetCode problems. 
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how different data structures and algorithms work under the hood, while also providing a convenient reference for future use.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of a wide range of algorithms and data structures, covering topics such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g. linear search, binary search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g. breadth-first search, depth-first search)
- Common datastructures (e.g. array, list, linked-list, hash-map)
- And much more!

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and browse through the different implementations.

To use any of the code in your own projects, simply copy the relevant files into your Java project and import them as needed. Additionally, the code includes comments explaining the logic and usage of each algorithm or data structure.
